# Description

Lazy Admin is application made for handling PowerShell scripts via GUI. It is especially useful in environments, where most administrators are inexperienced PowerShell users. Build your own definitions in simple JSON format to allow everyone to use PowerShell via simple HTML forms. Besides allowing to use shell commands via GUI, Lazy Admin offers additional functions like storing previous commands, parameters and outputs, exporting to CSV or chaining commands together, allowing users to use more complex workflows, and there is much more to come!
